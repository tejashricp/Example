1.Write a method to convert a number (range : 0 to 9 billion) to a String literal, e.g. sample input : 12345 , sample output : Twelve Thousand Three Hundred Forty Five.
2. Merge two array lists to one without using inbuilt functions, map and set, remove all duplicates from merged list, and also print number of duplicates.
3. Two tables were given with Foreign key relation on one table with other, and 2 scenarios were given, need to write SQL with join, aggregate operators etc between both tables and get results.

7.Write a program for equals() method to compare contents of 2 objects, I used instanceOf operator to verify class type, but he asked me to change it in such way that all subclass objects (with same contents) also return false when compared using equals() method, so I used getClass() method instead of instanceOf for comparison of object type.
8.Write a method which take list as input, and return any random value from List as output, with probability of return should be same for all elements of the list, you are given a helper random function which gives value from 0.0000 to 0.9999999 (consider these numbers are highly precise, and we need not to worry for precision). I was not able to come up with equal probability approach, so finally he gave some clues, with which I got the answer.
9.Given an int array, arrange the elements in increasing decreasing order i.e. one element bigger than a smaller element then bigger and so on.
