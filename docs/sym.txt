2. Rules of Overloading
In terms of constraints between overloaded methods, overloading is more relaxed than overriding, as the only requirement is to change the arguments, in combination of quantity and types. The return types, access modifiers and throws clauses can be freely declared. To summary, the overloaded methods:
Must have different arguments list (quantity and types).
May have different return types.
May have different access modifiers.
May throw different exceptions.
Which overloaded methods to be invoked is decided at compile time, based on the actual number of arguments and the compile-time types of the arguments.

======================
1. Write a method to convert a number (range : 0 to 9 billion) to a String literal, e.g. sample input : 12345 , sample output : Twelve Thousand Three Hundred Forty Five.
2. Merge two array lists to one without using inbuilt functions, map and set, remove all duplicates from merged list, and also print number of duplicates.
3. Two tables were given with Foreign key relation on one table with other, and 2 scenarios were given, need to write SQL with join, aggregate operators etc between both tables and get results.
